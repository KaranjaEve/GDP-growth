Explanation

**The 2008 -2009 Global financial crisis** explains the decrease in GDP growth (as seen in GDP Growth rate.png) in both the EA and EU. Both economies were however  quick to recover due to various fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the EU and EA, most notably the European economic recovery plan (EERP) that was launched in 2008. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) supported  the banking sector liquidity and accommodated for  funding needs through:
increase of deposit insurance ceilings
providing guarantees for bank liabilities
recapitalising banks. 
Governments also increased their welfare payments as well as tax relief and subsidies for part time employment

**2010’s**

These fiscal policies continued in the 2010’s as both the EU and EA saw the need to strengthen their economies to avoid a major disruption due to economic shocks as previously experienced. The bodies focused on reducing government debts to prevent future sovereign defaults in order to enhance economic resilience. 
It is important to note that the Euro Area went further to introduce a temporary crisis resolution mechanism providing financial assistance (complemented by bilateral loans) and funded through issuing bonds and other debt instruments on capital markets – The European financial stability mechanism(EFSM).
Between 2008 and 2017, the ratio of investment to GDP decreased in 24 of the 28 Member States.

**2019 -2020 Covid Pandemic**

Growth across the EA while that of EU decreased by 5.5%.
However due to the existing fiscal and monetary frameworks established in both the EU and EA, both economies rebounded strongly , recording a GDP growth rate of over 6% in 2021.

**2021 -2022 Energy crisis**

Following the pandemic recovery, the  2021 -2022 energy crisis intensified by geo-political tensions and reduced gas supplies from Ukraine, resulted to a further decline in GDP growth. In response, the EU and EA adopted policies aimed at  stabilizing energy prices ,reducing  their dependency on Russian gas and accelerating transition to clean and renewable energy sources.
